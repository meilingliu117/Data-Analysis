## [Case Study 1: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist From Kaggle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iOBllXiCrNJ_HzoHUcwQBiX4sq_aagEw/view?usp=sharing)

### Prompt
The ultimate prompt of this case study is to find ways to expand Olist. Since Olist connects small businesses with a single contract, then in order to make Olist bigger, we must increase the number of sellers. More sellers will be more willing to be in contract with Olist if Olist have a large customers database. To attract more customers, we can do three things:

  1.	Increase varieties of popular items
  2.	Excite customers with discounts
  3.	Increase customers satisfaction
  
**Increase varieties of popular items**

In this circle chart, each circle represents a category. The size of the circle represents the total number of items sold in this category. The color of the circle represents the number of distinct items the category contains. From this chart, we can see that bed_bath_table category has the most distinct items and sold the most items. 

**Conclusion:**
We can increase the number of sellers in computers_accessories and watches_gifts.


**Excite customers with discounts**

![category which month for discount](/CaseStudy1_images/category which month for discount.JPG)

This bar chart shows the monthly sales for categories with top sales including bed_bath_table, computers_accessoriesm furniture_decor, health_beauty, sports_leisure. The months with the top sales are labeled with the number of items sold in the corresponding month.

**Conclusion:**
Customers will love to encounter discount on items when they needed them the most. This will largely increase their willingness to purchase. Bed_bath_table category can have a discount on July, Computers_accessories category on February, and so forth.


**Increase customers satisfaction**

After translating many comments, I categorized the low rating reasons into 3 categories:
  1.	The customers did not receive the orders on time or did not receive the orders at all
  2.	The customers received incomplete orders, incorrect orders, and/or items with terrible qualities
  3.	No responds from emails. No responds to requests for refunds.

Possible solutions to the problems:
  1.	Have Olist logistic partners update on current statuses of the orders more frequently to assure customers about their orders. Also, take picture of delivered packages and upload to customer package tracking site to ensure customers of delivered packages.
  2.	Advice every seller to create a double-checking system to ensure the correctness and completeness of the orders before sending out. 
  3.	Must ensure the customer service team to respond to customer emails within 2 business days. Valid refunds are top priorities. Must let sellers know before they send out the orders.
