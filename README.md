#### Prompt
The ultimate prompt of this case study is to find ways to expand Olist. Since Olist connects small businesses with a single contract, then in order to make Olist bigger, we must increase the number of sellers. More sellers will be more willing to be in contract with Olist if Olist have a large customers database. To attract more customers, we can do three things:

  1.	Increase varieties of popular items
  2.	Excite customers with discounts
  3.	Increase customers satisfaction
  
##### Increase varieties of popular items
